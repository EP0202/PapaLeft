# NYC Traffic Related Incidents Resulting in Injury/Death

# The purpose of this project was to take a close look at the traffic accidents that occured within NYC in the past ten years (2014-2023).
# Data was obtained from a public dataset on BigQuery. SQL was used to organize the dataset as well as to create new columns for the total injuries and total deaths reported. 
# Python was used to further clean and organize the dataset and to perform statistical analysis and bar and pie chart visualizations. 
# Data analysis looked at the relation between injuries and deaths with type of vehicles involved, contributing factors, time(years/months/days/hours) and locations within NYC that experience the most traffic related injuries. 
# Tableau was used last to display relevant findings.
